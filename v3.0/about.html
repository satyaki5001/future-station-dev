        <p><b>Integrated Report Development</b></p>
        <p>On 6 February 2017, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) released a circular advising the Top 500 listed entities in India to adhere to integrated reporting (IR) on a voluntary basis from the financial year ending 31st March 2018. We support our clients in developing Integrated Reports</p>

        <p><b>An increasing need from investors for more information</b></p>

        <p>Over the past four decades, reporting has evolved in response to organizations’ focus on addressing investors’ demand for more information. However, despite this evolution, research indicates that investors believe disclosure shortfalls remain, especially in the reporting of strategy, risks and future performance. Also, non-financial information, which is often disclosed in different ways, is not easily comparable between organizations. The need for more information related to Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) was never in such demand earlier.</p>

        <p>Investors agree that ESG aspects present risks and opportunities that have been neglected for too long and also assert that sustainable returns require a sharper focus on corporate governance, environmental and social considerations.</p>

        <p>The importance of disclosure and scrutiny of non-financial information is set to grow in the years ahead. There is a growing belief among investors about recent environmental and social scandals driving a need to re-evaluate non-financial disclosures and the information already available.</p>

        <p>Investors believe the biggest motivator for companies to report ESG information is its potential to impact companies’ reputation among their customers and regulators.</p>

        <p><b>A new concept of value</b></p>
        <p>Over time, the market value of organizations has slowly and gradually shifted from one that was based largely on tangible assets to one that puts a greater emphasis on intangible assets. This reflects a fundamental change in how value is being defined and perceived. Many progressive companies today have a market capitalization that is in multiples of the actual value that is reflected on their balance sheet. Having said that, investors and analysts continue to struggle to find a sustainable correlation between past performance, value reflected on the balance sheet, risks and opportunities, future prospects and the market capitalization of companies.</p>

        <p><b>The genesis of IR</b></p>

        <p>The global economic crisis that began in early 2008 severely impacted investor confidence, creating a need that saw the eventual setting up of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) in 2010, with a focus on improving the confidence of investors. The reporting framework that the IIRC created seeks to provide investors with information that is material to their decision making process. Ultimately, an integrated report should explain the reporting entity’s interrelated financial, environmental, social and corporate governance information. It should be presented in a clear, concise, consistent and comparable manner. And disclosure should be retrospective and prospective to better match investors’ needs. By doing so, organizations could improve their ability to access capital.</p>

        <p><b>The key components of an integrated report</b></p>

        <br><br>

        <p><b>The business model: </b></p>
        <p>The definition of the business model lies at the heart of the integrated report. It defines the essence of the organization and maps out the processes by which sustainable value is created.</p>
        <p><b>The multiple capitals model: </b></p>
        <p>A central tenet of IR is a belief that sustainable development requires a balance between economic progress, social advances and environmental protection. IR requires capturing the full contribution of all capitals to effectively demonstrate business performance. The IIRC has identified six forms of capital: Natural, social and relationship, human, intellectual, manufactured and financial. Prevailing accounting regulations seriously limit the ability to recognize internally generated intangible assets on the balance sheet. IR aims to track how the various capitals are used, how they relate to each other and the trade-offs the organization makes. The business model and strategy articulate how capitals will translate into value creation and can be measured by the use of key performance indicators.</p>

        <p><b>Strategy and key performance indicators:</b></p>
        <p>The strategy is expected to describe the process and tools earmarked for value creation for shareholders and other key stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, employees and the society. The exercise also enables organizations to understand how to minimize negative externalities (externalities are an organization’s impact, whether positive or negative, on capitals, including society as a whole) and maximize the positive ones. This could help shore up the value of an organization’s intangible assets and, by extension, their performance. Integrated reports are expected to disclose the KPIs used by management to track performance. This helps investors compare organizations on their performance.</p>

        <p><b>Risk and opportunity management:</b></p>

        <p>Effective risk management is crucial to ensuring the viability of the value creation process and achieving the strategic value creation targets. This requires incorporating risk management into the organization’s decision-making process as well as strategy, while aligning it with prevailing industry circumstances. It seeks to reduce uncertainty about an organization’s performance and future resilience. At the same time, it is also important to explain risk management processes in the integrated report as they are a clear contributor to the likely value in the long-term.</p>

        <p><b>Materiality: </b></p>
        <p>A materiality assessment is crucial to ensuring that the report includes the factors that significantly impact value creation in the immediate term, and the performance over the longer term.</p>

        <p><b>The global experience</b></p>
        <p>The Integrated Reporting Framework was launched in December 2013 and since then has been used by companies across the world — mostly because they found a strong business case in being able to use it for improving the trust and confidence of investors and other stakeholders.</p>
