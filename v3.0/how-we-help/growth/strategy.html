        <h1>Sustainability Strategy</h1>

    <p>Integration of sustainability into long-term business strategy and growth plans is becoming increasingly important. A well defined sustainability strategy enables an organization to devise a road map that considers its stakeholders’ views, is realistic and provides measurable sustainability metrics to track its performance against its stated goals. This creates sustainable value for the company’s stakeholders while improving its bottom line.</p>
    <p>We understand the sustainability drivers of our clients’ businesses and leverage these while putting in place well-designed strategies that incorporate a well-accepted methodology. The process of developing a sustainable strategy is founded on an understanding of an organization’s internal “as is” situation by assessing its baseline systems and compliance record.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Our standard methodology involves the following</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identification of top sustainability KPIs for the sector/company</li>
        <li>Identify global as well as local benchmark companies whose sustainability KPIs are available in their public reports</li>
        <li>Assess the maturity of our client on these KPIs with respect to the benchmark companies and draw up actionable plans</li>
        <li>Support to client in implementing the plans</li>
    </ul>
