        <h1>Project monitoring and evaluation</h1>
        <p>The journey towards sustainability in India is driven by large-scale projects aimed at improving the social, environmental and economic conditions of the millions of citizens of the country still struggling to shake off the chains of poverty. These projects are primarily funded by bilateral or multilateral funds such as the World Bank, ADB, the European Commission, USAID, UNDP and UNEP or by central and state-level governments. Monitoring and evaluating the success of these projects can be quite challenging, especially from a non-financial perspective. Monitoring is the regular or routine measurement of the progress of a program/project focusing on project implementation and tracking progress toward a predetermined set of objectives. Evaluation is a periodic assessment of the efficiency, effectiveness, impact, sustainability and relevance of an operation in the context of the stated objectives. Evaluation is usually undertaken as an independent examination of the background, objectives, results, activities and means deployed, with a view to drawing lessons that may guide future decision-making. It is a systemic search for answers concerning the design, implementation and effectiveness of a project or program.</p>

        <p>Effective Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) is critical to the success of large-scale sustainability and development projects, especially given the socio-economic volatility in India. This is especially true for multi-year projects, which are often questioned about their effectiveness and relevance and are often bogged down due to ineffectual M&E. Effective M&E leads to better measurement, monitoring and management of project results. It also helps donors ensure the achievement of over-arching development objectives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) over and above the individual project objectives. For community-based organizations (CBOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are responsible for the implementation of large project, a strong focus on M&E along with better governance can help attract even greater aid flows. The following are the major benefits of M&E:</p>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We provide M&E services during which we carry out evaluations of existing programs/projects through stakeholder consultations, data review, site visits and the development of a logical framework. Out approach is summarized below:</p><br><br>
