        <p>The global population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, and a large chunk of this population explosion will take place in developing countries such as India as economies continue to grow and healthcare continues to improve. Developing countries will, therefore, require substantial amounts of investment in their infrastructure to meet the needs of their growing populations. Besides public sector and private sector investment, which can at times be sporadic, this growth in infrastructure will also need to be funded through bilateral and multilateral funds. The World Bank Group alone provided US$11.7 billion of official development finance (ODF) for infrastructure development in developing countries in 2013[6]. It was primarily targeted at reducing the gap between current infrastructure investment and the forecasted infrastructure investment needed across critical sectors such as energy, water and sanitation, transport and communications by 2030.</p><br><br>

        <p>The flow of finance from outside India is often accompanied by stringent Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS )requirements, which are a set of actions and procedures that are implemented concurrently with existing risk management procedures.</p>
        <p>India was the largest recipient of ODF to infrastructure in 2013. This is a trend that will continue to grow with several international funding institutions (IFIs) now providing loans for infrastructure development through Indian financial institutions (commercial banks and NBFCs). However, these loans come with stringent ESMS requirements, which can be quite a challenge for both financial institutions in charge of funds disbursal as well as their clients who must comply with ESMS requirements such as IFC Performance Standards and WBG’s environmental, health and safety (EHS) guidelines, along with existing national and state-level statutory requirements.</p>
        <p>Ensuring internal compliance and compliance of clients with ESMS requirements can help companies in the financial sector attract loans from IFIs for the development of infrastructure, especially “green” infrastructure. Internal compliance with ESMS regulations can help companies — especially in high-impact sectors such as power, metals and mining, construction, oil and gas, and pulp and paper — attract financing for the development of “green” initiatives such as switching to renewables, energy efficiency, sustainable water management and solid waste management.</p>
        <p>The major benefits of ESMS compliance are as follows:</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Improvement in risk management systems</li>
            <li>Increase in enterprise value</li>
            <li>Increased flexibility in attracting funds</li>
            <li>Increased stakeholder engagement</li>
            <li>Reduction in volatility of business performance</li>
            <li>Improved branding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We provide  solutions related to ESMS compliance to companies in several sectors. Our approach to executing these engagements is illustrated below:</p><br><br>
